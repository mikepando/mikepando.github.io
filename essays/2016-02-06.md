##Introduction

Every day, users willingly or unknowingly give up compromising information to the websites and networks they use. Whether it be uploading photos with location based meta-data attached or having internet traffic analyzed on a public network, identifying the user. Even to the point of allowing websites to farm user information to create profiles for marketing or other purposes. Privacy is an important issue and people are not protecting themselves. With privacy appearing to be difficult to achieve for less-technically savvy people, the development of the Tor Browser was an initiative to combat that. As people’s awareness of tracking, surveillance, and censorship has increased, so has the hindrances to prevent internet freedom. The Tor Project is a network that has thousands of relays run by volunteers and users around the world. It provides anonymity and security for users, while fighting for an uncensored, unrestricted internet. It is one of the strongest tools for privacy and freedom online. 

This project will aim to analyze the tweets and users surrounding the Tor Project twitter account. As they are on the forefronts of internet freedom the discussion around certain topics and events will be our focus. We also aim to look at the users who are passionate about the Tor Project, and see if they practice proper privacy methods. This project will utilize the R language for our data visualization and manipulation, as well as the Twitter API for sourcing our data

##Environment Setup

In order to harvest tweets, the following will be required. This project assumes that you already have a Twitter developer account with an application and the respective keys for API access.

```js
install.packages("twitteR")
install.packages("ROAuth")
install.packages("tokenizers")
install.packages("wordcloud")
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("XML")
install.packages("igraph")

library(twitteR)
library(ROAuth)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tokenizers)
library(tm)
library(ggplot2)
library(XML)
library(igraph)
```

Our Twitter API credentials are stored in a Rdata file titled cred611. We will create a handshake between our RStudio workspace and Twitter

```js
load(file="cred611.rdata")
setup_twitter_oauth(cred611$consumerKey, cred611$consumerSecret, cred611$oauthKey, cred611$oauthSecret)
```

##The Tor Project’s User Account

The primary focus of our project will be the @torproject Twitter account. This account will be the root of our project. We will analyze their timeline, followers, accounts interacted with, and keywords associated with their operations. We will associate this Twitter account with the screenname variable. 

```js
screenname="torproject";
user <- getUser(screenname)
```

We can now issue commands associated with the user variable to get information regarding the Tor Project twitter account. We can find the current number of followers, the number of people they follow, the number of tweets they have issued, as well as when the account was created. 

```js
user$followersCount 		#shows the current number of followers the account has
user$friendsCount		#shows the number of accounts @torproject follows
user$statusesCount		#shows the number of tweets that have been tweeted
user$created		#returns the date that the account was created on the Twitter platform
user$verified		#returns whether the account has been verified as authentic by Twitter
```

The account currently has 293,603 followers, 1,319 users followed, and 7,645 tweets since its creation 11 years ago on December 30, 2008. We can also see that the account is authentic, because verified returns ‘TRUE’. This information is simple but useful, as it allows us to see the type of reach @torproject has. We can assume that the account is rather active, with an average of 1.9 tweets per day. But in the grand scheme of things, this number is low when compared to other Twitter and media accounts. @torproject tweets mostly about development updates towards their platform as well as information and news regarding current events in the technology, security and data sector. We can assume that most of our data will be related to these topics and have an expectation of what to expect.

##The Tor Project’s Timeline Tweets

Now that we have a basis of what @torproject is about, we will have a better understanding of what we are looking at when we pick apart their tweets. We will first only pull the user’s tweets from their timeline.
