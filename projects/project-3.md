summary: A project utilizing Alpha Vantage stock API and the Pandas library to plot hourly closing stock prices.
---

A small project in order to utlize the [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) API library alongside the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to gather and plot the intra-day closing values of a designated public company.

This project uses Jupyter notebook to allow sequential execution of python code, in order to generate a CSV of stock data, as well as an HTML page where plots of the closing prices are plotted hourly. This project was a test of Pandas visualization using stock data from the Alpha vantage API. The HTML page is pretty basic, but it just meant to be a simple representation of our data.

Here is an example of the generated page:
