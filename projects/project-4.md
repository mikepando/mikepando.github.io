<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/geofilter_icon.png"> 

I designed a geofilter for the multimedia messaging app, Snapchat. 

I wanted to create a good representation of Manhattan College, that would allow Snapchat users to express their school pride. 

I used Adobe Photoshop to design and the filter. This should have been made in Illustrator, not rasterized in photoshop. But Photoshop was the program I was most comfortable with in 2016.

*This filter has been publicly available around the Manhattan College campus since 2016. As a community filter, this had to be submitted and approved by Snapchat.*
