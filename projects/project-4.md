summary: A location-based Snapchat filter designed for Manhattan College.

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/geofilter_icon.png"> 

I designed a geofilter for the multimedia messaging app, Snapchat. 

I wanted to create a good representation of Manhattan College, that would allow Snapchat users to express their school pride. 


*This filter has been publicly available around the Manhattan College campus since 2016. As a community filter, this had to be submitted and approved by Snapchat.*
