<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/geofilter_icon.png"> 

I designed a geofilter for the multimedia messaging app, Snapchat. I wanted to create a good representation of Manhattan College, that would also allow Snapchat users to proudly express their school pride. 

Geofilters are location based, meaning they are only accessible in certain locations. As a community filter, this had to be submitted and approved by Snapchat. This filter has been publicly available around the Manhattan College campus since 2016.
